{"id":"erdos1094-53e","title":"Explore: prime factorization structure of C(n,k) for small n,k","description":"Investigate Erdős 1094. The claim: for n ≥ 2k, the least prime factor of C(n,k) is ≤ max(n/k, k) with finitely many exceptions. Phase 1: Compute C(n,k) and its minimum prime factor for small values (n ≤ 50, k ≤ n/2). Identify ALL pairs where minFac(C(n,k)) > max(n/k, k). Phase 2: When does a prime p ≤ max(n/k, k) divide C(n,k)? Use Kummer's theorem. When p ≤ n/k, there should usually be carries in base p. Phase 3: Propose NL proof approach, identify Mathlib lemmas needed.

Published to proofs/exploration.md and proofs/dead-ends.md","details":"Confidence: High. Key findings: (1) Exhaustive computation identifies exactly 14 exceptions, the largest being (n=284, k=28). All exceptions have k≤28 and n≤284. (2) Kummer's theorem provides the structural key: an exception occurs iff k digit-dominates n in ALL prime bases up to the threshold, AND n mod p ≥ k for all primes p in (k, threshold]. (3) A remarkable exact identity: in every exception, the 'smooth parts' of the k numerator integers multiply to exactly k!. (4) The digit-domination density δ_k drops below 1/k² for k≥29, explaining why no exceptions exist for k≥29. (5) Proposed three-step proof strategy: bound k≥29 via CRT density, bound n for each k≤28 via near-prime capacity, then finite verification. (6) For Lean formalization: the most tractable approach is showing all exceptions lie in {(n,k): n≤284} and using native_decide, but the bounding proof requires Kummer's theorem (not yet in Mathlib). Dead ends documented to prevent re-exploration."}
