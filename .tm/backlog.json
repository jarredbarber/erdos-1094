Both gaps identified in the original review (erdos1094-2gy) have been fully addressed:\n\n**Gap 1 (k ∈ [10001, 10^7] density argument rigor):** RESOLVED. The revision correctly limits the rigorous theorem statement (Section 6) to k ∈ [29, 10000] only. Section 7.2 is now explicitly labeled 'heuristic justification' and includes the critical caveat that density < 1 is 'necessary but not sufficient' for zero solutions.\n\n**Gap 2 (k > 10^7 asymptotic completeness):** RESOLVED. Section 7.4 is now labeled 'sketch' and Section 10 explicitly acknowledges that 'full rigor requires effective Baker-Stewart bounds.' The asymptotic argument is presented as strong heuristic evidence, not rigorous proof.\n\n**Verification of rigorous part (k ∈ [29, 10000]):**\n- ✓ CRT framework (Section 2) is mathematically correct\n- ✓ Lemma 1 (M_k > k²) proof is valid  \n- ✓ Algorithm EXHAUSTIVE_CRT_VERIFY correctness argument is sound\n- ✓ Explicit computations for k=29,30 spot-checked and correct\n- ✓ Dependency proofs/kummer-theorem.md is Verified ✅\n- ✓ Main theorem statement precisely scoped to verified range\n- ✓ Section 10 summary table clearly delineates rigorous vs. heuristic claims\n\n**Conclusion:** The proof is rigorous within its stated scope (k ∈ [29, 10000]) and appropriately honest about its limitations beyond that scope.
