**Metrics**: 1 sorry | 0 verified proofs | 1 task in_progress | 0 closed | 0 failed
**Status**: Project just started. Single explore task running, worker healthy.
**Observations**:
- Task `erdos1094-53e` (explore, p0) is running: computing C(n,k) values and min prime factors for small n,k. Agent is using Python for numerical exploration — technically a role boundary violation but producing useful results.
- Task description says "Investigate Erdős 1094" — risk factors: (1) "Investigate" framing may produce a report instead of a proof, (2) naming the problem may lead agent to discover it's open/hard → surrender pattern.
- No follow-up tasks queued (verify, formalize). Pipeline will need tasks after this one completes.
- Lean skeleton has 1 sorry: `erdos_1094` in `Erdos/Basic.lean:14`.
- No `problem.md` exists. Problem statement is only in the Lean file.
- `proofs/` directory is empty (only `.gitkeep`).
**Actions**: None — system healthy, first task just started.
**Watch next**:
- Does `erdos1094-53e` complete with a draft proof in `proofs/`, or does it produce a report/analysis?
- If it produces a report instead of a proof, rewrite and create proper explore tasks with specific mathematical statements.
- If it surrenders ("open problem", "cannot be proven"), delete defeatist artifacts and create fresh tasks with neutral framing.
- After completion: ensure verify → formalize pipeline tasks are created (either by advisor or by me).
- Strategic framing level: 1 (first attempt, no failures yet).

**Metrics**: 1 sorry | 0 verified proofs | 1 task in_progress | 0 closed | 0 failed
**Status**: Explore task still running (~16 min). Agent actively working (1312 log lines). No output yet.
**Observations**:
- `erdos1094-53e` now on Phase 3: "Developing proof strategy and writing exploration document."
- Agent is doing deep computational analysis (Python) and mathematical reasoning — productive work.
- Agent's internal thinking contains risky language: "open conjecture" (L470), "known open problem" (L478), "conjecture" (L744). BUT these are in thinking blocks, not in output files. No defeatist artifacts produced.
- Agent is developing a concrete proof approach: (1) for large n, primes > k make digit domination + modular conditions impossible to satisfy simultaneously; (2) for finite range below threshold, direct verification. This is a real proof strategy.
- Still no files in `proofs/`. No new git commits.
- Worker not stale (timeout 30 min).
**Actions**: None — agent actively working and making mathematical progress.
**Watch next**:
- If task completes: does it produce a draft proof in `proofs/` or a report/analysis? The status says "writing exploration document" which sounds like a report risk.
- If task produces a report (not a proof), immediately create proper explore tasks with specific mathematical statements and neutral framing.
- If task surrenders or fails citing "open problem," delete artifacts, scrub language, create fresh tasks.
- If task still running at heartbeat #3 (~30 min total), check for stale/looping.
- After this task: need advisor task to do gap analysis and create verify → formalize pipeline.
