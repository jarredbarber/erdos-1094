**Time:** 2026-02-11T17:45:21.174Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

✅ **ROUTINE HEARTBEAT — NO INTERVENTION**

**State:** 64v IN_PROGRESS (4 min post-recovery), logs active, 0 stale, system healthy.

**Comparison to HB#54 memory entry:** 
- Status unchanged (analysis phase continuing)
- Logs show continuous work (timing tests progressing)
- No new patterns detected

**Decision:** No memory update. Memory entry HB#54 captures the important pattern (stale detector overly conservative, logs-based verification required). Continue routine monitoring.
