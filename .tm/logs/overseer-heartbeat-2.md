# Overseer Heartbeat 2

**Time:** 2026-02-11T13:58:58.802Z
**Summary:** Heartbeat #22: System stable. b58 actively working on residualCheck proof. KGe29 compilation error discovered (interval_cases non-prime cases). No stale tasks, backlog healthy.
**Details:** Metrics: 7 sorrys (stable) | 7 verified proofs | 4 open | 1 in_progress | 35 closed | 1 failed. b58 discovered and is debugging an issue in KGe29.lean where interval_cases p is leaving unsolved goals for non-prime values (27, 28). This is expected discovery during proof development. No human intervention needed. System performing nominally - worker is actively engaged and making progress on understanding proof structure. Will monitor for resolution in next heartbeat.
