**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**Heartbeat #43 (final) — 16:50:05 UTC**

**Status:** ✅ **No intervention. u5p actively working (71 min elapsed).**

**Activity Verified:**
- ✅ Recent logs show active exploration of recursion depth & rewrite loops
- ✅ Iterating on `split` alternatives and direct application approaches
- ✅ Multiple edit/build cycles (no compilation errors)
- ✅ Legitimate complex formalization work

**Metrics:**
- 5 sorrys | 3 open, 1 in_progress (u5p: 71 min)
- Last commit: 863f246 (ilj, 71 min ago)
- Expected: No new commits until proof closure

**Decision:** Continue monitoring.
- **Hard escalation point**: 90+ min elapsed WITHOUT new commit AND log silence
- **Current state**: 71 min, logs active → proceed normally

**No memory update.** HB#29 framework validated across HB#40-43.

System executing as designed.
