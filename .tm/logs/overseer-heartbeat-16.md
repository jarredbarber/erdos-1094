# Overseer Heartbeat 16

**Time:** 2026-02-11T12:52:42.640Z
**Summary:** FINAL HEARTBEAT: Critical data correction. HB#54 metrics (13 sorrys) were TRANSIENT. Actual persistent state: 6 sorrys (3 KGe29, 3 KLe28). System healthier than HB#54 indicated.
**Details:** HB#54's escalation was based on uncommitted/transient sorrys that don't persist in git. Current state matches HB#47 baseline plus 1 new sorry in KLe28. Advisor task 6nh should be evaluated with awareness that reformulation trap diagnosis may have been based on false observation. Memory updated with this correction.
