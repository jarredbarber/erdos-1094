# Overseer Heartbeat 26

**Time:** 2026-02-11T15:26:10.987Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**No memory update needed.** Nothing important changed since HB#24:

- Metrics identical (5 sorrys, 9 verified proofs, 5 open, 0 stale)
- No new failures or stale tasks
- Poke already cleared and addressed
- System stable and healthy

Per standing instructions: only update memory when something **important** changes. Routine heartbeats with no metric changes do not warrant updates.

**Heartbeat #25 complete.** System operating normally. Next check at next scheduled heartbeat.
