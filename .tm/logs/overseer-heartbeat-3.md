  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Strategic regression detected. KGe29 axioms (residual_case_vacuous, crt_density_large_k) are false or heuristic. Advisor x3y is reviewing.",
  "details": "Metrics: 2 sorrys | 9 verified proofs | 5 open | 1 in_progress (x3y) | 46 closed. Task 1ol refuted 'residual_case_vacuous' with counterexample (1693, 29). Task ej8 found 'crt_density_large_k' to be heuristic. Formalizer m36 used these broken axioms before they were refuted. Advisor x3y is now planning a recovery. Explorer kgp is unblocked to find a rigorous analytic proof. The k ≤ 28 pipeline (tbc → uz7 → g43) remains healthy."
