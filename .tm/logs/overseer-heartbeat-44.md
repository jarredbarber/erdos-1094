# Overseer Heartbeat 44

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:24:30.401Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**Heartbeat #39 — 16:24:21 UTC**

**Status:** ✅ **No action. u5p still progressing.**

**Metrics (unchanged):**
- 5 sorrys
- 3 open, 1 in_progress (u5p: 45 min elapsed)
- 0 stale (threshold 30 min, but system marks as active)
- Last commit: 863f246 (ilj, 45 min ago)

**u5p Status:** Still IN_PROGRESS, not flagged as stale yet. At HB#37, logs confirmed active work. Continuing to monitor. Complex number-theoretic formalization on p1 priority justifies extended duration.

**Next check (HB#40):** If u5p remains in_progress with >60 min elapsed and no new commit, will check logs for activity status.

**No memory update.**
