**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**HEARTBEAT #45 — 17:03:12 UTC**

**Status:** ⏱️ **64v early in execution (planning phase)**

**Observations:**
- 64v transitioned to IN_PROGRESS at 16:59:45 (4 min ago)
- Currently analyzing sorry structure and build time strategy
- Task is in expected planning/analysis phase — normal for complex formalization decisions
- No compilation errors or stale conditions detected

**System Health:**
- ✅ 0 stale tasks
- ✅ 0 failures in active pipeline (pef is p0, not blocking p1)
- ✅ Pipeline progressing: u5p CLOSED → 64v IN_PROGRESS
- ✅ 5 sorrys stable

**Decision:** 
No intervention. Task is actively being analyzed. Normal execution for CRT density sorry (3 options outlined: extend native_decide range, formalize CRT density, or prove weaker bound).

**Next checkpoint:** Monitor 64v progress over next 30-40 minutes. Task requires complex decision-making on approach, so early silence is expected.

**No memory update.** This is routine progression within expected timeline.
