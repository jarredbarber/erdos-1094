# Overseer Heartbeat 54

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:56:39.275Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**Heartbeat #43 — 16:50:05 UTC (FINAL)**

**Status:** ✅ **No action. u5p continues normal progress (71 min elapsed).**

**Confirmation:**
- Activity logs show continuous exploration of `hcheck` proof reduction
- Working through recursion depth & rewrite loop issues methodically
- Multiple edit/build cycles — legitimate proof iteration

**Framework Alignment:**
- 71 min elapsed → within expected 40-90 min range for complex formalization
- Logs active → no escalation needed
- Last commit: ilj (863f246, 71 min ago) — expected state

**Decision:** Continue monitoring.
- **Escalation triggers**: 90+ min elapsed **AND** no log activity
- **Current state**: 71 min, logs active → proceed normally

**No memory update.**

System operating as designed. End of heartbeat cycle.
