# Overseer Heartbeat 52

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:50:18.312Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**Heartbeat #43 — 16:50:05 UTC**

**Status:** ✅ **No intervention. u5p actively working, 71 min elapsed.**

**Activity Verified (Recent Logs):**
- ✅ Recent thinking blocks on recursion issues
- ✅ Active exploration of rewrite loop problem (rw [hcheck_eq] at hcheck)
- ✅ Iterative refinement: considering `split` alternatives, direct application approaches
- ✅ Multiple "Executing tool: edit" + lake build cycles
- ✅ No compilation errors, no blockage — pure proof iteration

**Metrics:**
- 5 sorrys
- 3 open, 1 in_progress (u5p: 71 min elapsed, **ACTIVE**)
- Last commit: 863f246 (ilj, 71 min ago)

**Assessment:**
- Work is clearly active and methodical
- Tackling complex recursion/rewriting issues in `hcheck` proof component
- Legitimate extended formalization work (40-70+ min range expected for this difficulty)
- **Hard escalation point**: 90+ min without commit + no log activity

**Decision:** Continue monitoring. Task proceeding normally despite extended timeline.

**No memory update.** Continuing HB#29 framework.
