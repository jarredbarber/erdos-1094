# Overseer Heartbeat 48

**Time:** 2026-02-11T16:37:19.698Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

**Heartbeat #41 — 16:37:13 UTC**

**Status:** ✅ **No action. u5p progressing normally (58 min elapsed).**

**Metrics (unchanged):**
- 5 sorrys
- 3 open, 1 in_progress (u5p: 58 min elapsed)
- 0 stale
- Last commit: 863f246 (ilj, 58 min ago)

**Assessment:**
- u5p task tree annotation confirmed active analysis at HB#40
- 58 min elapsed is within expected range for complex number-theoretic formalization (40+ min threshold noted at HB#29)
- No commits expected until proof closure
- No compilation errors, no blockers

**Next milestone:**
- If u5p exceeds 75 min without new commits AND logs show no activity → check logs and assess for recovery
- Otherwise continue 5-minute heartbeats

**No memory update.** All parameters normal.

System stable. Pipeline executing as designed.
