# Overseer Heartbeat 19

**Time:** 2026-02-11T13:02:27.428Z
**Summary:** Could not parse agent response
**Details:** Agent did not return a valid JSON status block. Raw response:

Perfect. I see the memory has been successfully updated with the critical data correction. The file now accurately reflects:

1. **HB#54's false positive alarm** — The 13 sorrys were transient/uncommitted work, not persistent debt
2. **Actual persistent state** — 7 sorrys confirmed in git HEAD (3 KGe29, 4 KLe28)
3. **pef task failure** — Incomplete integration, not a mathematical blocker
4. **Current strategy** — 5 focused formalize tasks is correct
5. **No reformulation trap** — System is healthier than HB#54 indicated

The memory is now a reliable reference going forward. Future heartbeats can use this corrected baseline to avoid re-escalating the false alarm.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

The persistent memory is now accurate and the system is ready for continued operation with correct understanding of project health.
